<p><strong>TECHNIQUE &ndash; THE BASICS</strong></p>
<p>Coaches often overlook the basic techniques of soccer and instead like to move straight into more complex practices and activities.</p>
<p>It is FAR more important for coaches to have a good understanding of these basics and to teach them to their players.</p>

<p>The first job of the first defender is to DELAY &ndash; the opposition player and makes them think about progressingforward any further! The first defender is the player on our team who is nearest to the ball!</p>

<p><strong>FIRST TOUCH (controlling a soccer ball)</strong></p>
<p>As you will see from the previous pages I highlighted the basic technique of <strong>receiving the ball</strong> &ndash; This is becauseI place this technique &ndash; as the highest priority for ANY would be soccer player &ndash; once a player masters thistechnique, confidence overflows, and all the other techniques and skills fall into place &ndash; If there is one thing I could&nbsp;add to ALL of my practices it would be this. Here is some more information on this technique.</p>
<p>Broadly defined, control is the ability to manipulate the ball and prepare it for a following touch. It is clearly one ofthe most essential skills in football. A bad first touch and the play is usually over for the attacking team.</p>
<p><strong>How to control the ball<br /></strong>There are two types of control, receiving and trapping. Receiving means directing the ball into space away from thebody and preparing for your next move - Trapping is stopping the ball right at your feet.</p>
<p><em><strong>Receiving</strong></em></p>
<p>Receiving is useful when running into space. Try to make contact with the middle or top part of the ball. Tap itlightly in the direction that you want to go. Good footballers can settle the ball into open space, even when underpressure. This often provides an extra step over the defender.</p>
<p><em><strong>Trapping</strong></em></p>
<p>Trapping is typically used when the ball is going too fast to redirect with your first touch. The most important parthere is staying loose and on your toes. You can't adjust to the ball when you're stiff or flat-footed. Try keeping yourhips open, facing the direction from where the ball is coming. Put your foot in the path of the ball and cushion it. Tocushion the ball, gently withdraw your foot just before the time of contact.</p>
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>
<p><strong>HOW TO PRACTICE CONTROL<br /></strong>The easiest way to practice control is with a partner. Your partner throws you the ball with his hands. Aftercontrolling the ball with a single, clean touch you pass it back to him.</p>
<p>If you lack a partner, you can use a wall. Simply stand at about 3-5 meters (10-15 feet) away from the wall andknock the ball against it. You then trap or receive the ball as it comes back to you. This exercise gives you thechance to work on both your kicking and control. As you get comfortable, start applying both feet. Eventually, trylofting the ball and incorporate speed by running to meet the oncoming ball.</p>
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>
<p><strong>DIFFERENT METHODS OF CONTROL TO PRACTICE</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Inside of the foot<br /></strong></em>Your supporting foot must be planted 45-90 degrees in relation to the path&nbsp;of the ball. Don't plant it flat, instead keep your weight on your toes. You&nbsp;should intercept the ball with the arch of your free foot. At the time of&nbsp;contact, cushion the ball by moving your foot along the ball's original path.</p>
<p>Instead of trapping the ball you may wish to redirect it. To do so, simply turn&nbsp;your receiving foot in the desired direction. <strong>Please coach the players to&nbsp;receive a pass on their back foot (the foot furthest away from the ball.)</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>Outside of the foot</strong></em></p>
<p>This technique is useful when the ball is coming in from the side. Rather thanturning your body into its path, you can control it using the outside of thefoot. Simply reach forward into the ball's path and intercept it with theoutside of your instep. That should settle it nicely considering that theoutside of your foot provides a lot of contact surface.</p>
<p><em><strong>Sole of the foot</strong></em></p>
<p>Simply put your foot on the ball with your toes raised slightly above your&nbsp;heel. Because of the modern game's speed, trapping with the sole of the foot&nbsp;is rarely applied to control passes. It can be useful in dribbling. Some playersuse it to stop right before changing direction or incorporate it in more&nbsp;elaborate combos.</p>
<p><em><strong>Instep<br /></strong></em>This technique is useful when the ball is falling from a steep angle. Don't just&nbsp;wait for the ball to arrive, stay on your toes and lock your eyes on it. Quickly&nbsp;adjust to its trajectory so that you don't have to reach out too far. Before the&nbsp;ball arrives, stretch the ankle of your controlling foot. Try to cushion the ball&nbsp;using the area around your shoelaces. At the moment of contact, withdraw&nbsp;your controlling foot by bending the knee and ankle. This should settle the&nbsp;ball right in front of you.</p>
<p><strong><em>Thigh</em><br /></strong>The thigh is especially useful in football when you want to trap the ball.&nbsp;Redirecting it into space is somewhat harder when you're using the thigh.&nbsp;Cushioning the ball with the thigh can be done for both rising and dropping&nbsp;balls. Make sure you position yourself properly, before you try to trap the&nbsp;ball. Once you have aligned yourself well, put your thigh in the path of the&nbsp;ball and angle it so that it's redirected downward. If you don't retract, the&nbsp;ball will just bounce off of you. The contact surface you should use is the area&nbsp;above the knee, about halfway on your thigh. The inside of your thigh is good&nbsp;for stopping balls that are flying straight at you.</p>
<p><em><strong>Chest<br /></strong></em>The chest provides the largest surface area for trapping or receiving the ball.&nbsp;When using it for control, stretch out your arms and flex your muscles. To&nbsp;cushion the ball, you'll need to arch your back slightly. You may also have tobend your knees or jump in order to align your chest with the height of the ball.</p>
<p><em><strong>Head<br /></strong></em>Set up your body just as if you're about to head the ball. Instead of heading&nbsp;it, simply intercept its path using the surface area on your forehead, just&nbsp;below the hairline. Just before making contact, turn your head in whatever&nbsp;direction you want the ball to go (receiving).&nbsp;If you just want to bring the ball to your feet (trapping) do not turn your&nbsp;head, instead bend your knees and lean forward with your upper body.</p>
