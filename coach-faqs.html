<p><a name="contact"></a><strong>Q: When should I contact my players?</strong><br/>
<strong>A:</strong>As soon as you receive your rosters, you can begin contacting the players.
</p>

<p><a name="pratice"></a><strong>Q: When and where can I practice with my team?</strong><br />
<strong>A:</strong>The NSC Field Director will take requests for practices and publish the final schedule listing fields and times. There are a lot of teams sharing the fields, so once the practice schedules have been finalized, please stick to your assigned slots.
</p>

<p><a name="games"></a><strong>Q: When are the games?<br /></strong>
<strong>A:</strong>A schedule will be published on <a title="BAYS" target="_blank" href="http://www.bays.org">www.bays.org</a> &mdash; except for special events. &nbsp;Games are held on Saturdays, in the morning for girls and the afternoon for boys.</p>

<p><a name="rain"></a><strong>Q: What happens when it rains?<br /></strong>
<strong>A:</strong>The Field Director and NSC President will determine the condition of the fields, 2 hours prior to game time. If we need to cancel, phone calls and an email will be sent to all coaches and northsoccerclub.com will be updated to announce the cancellation. You are responsible for contacting the opposing coach 2 hours prior to your game. A sprinkle is not cause for cancellation. If the fields are safe, we play.</p>

<p><a name="parents_stay"></a><strong>Q: Do the parents have to stay for the practices and games?<br /></strong>
<strong>A:</strong>Parents should be present at all practices and games. We do understand that due to conflicts in schedules, sometimes a parent will have to leave. When this occurs, the child should not be left with the coach unless there is a signed Medical Release form completed, and it is the parent's responsibility to ensure that the child has a ride home. Coaches will not leave a young child unattended at the field, but they are not daycare providers.</p>

<p><a name="rules"></a><strong>Q: What are the rules of the game in each division? How many players on each side, etc?<br /></strong>
<strong>A:</strong>The rules are dependent upon age: U10 &amp; under play 6v6; U12 play 8v8; U14 &amp; up play 11v11. You can consult the BAYS Rule Book for all the details.</p>

<p><a name="equipment"></a><strong>Q: What if I need equipment, like cones and pinneys?<br /></strong>
<strong>A:</strong> Please contact the Equipment Director for all coaching supplies and North Soccer official jersey/uniform issues.</p>

<p><a name="coach"></a><strong>Q: What if I have an issue with another coach?<br /></strong>
<strong>A:</strong>Please try to deal with the issue in a calm and responsible manner. If you cannot resolve the situation amongst yourselves, report it to the NSC President. They will take care of it, and/or bring it to the attention of the board if necessary. Refrain from any inappropriate comments concerning the players, the coaches, the refs, or parents. Verbal or physical violence will not be tolerated.</p>

<p><a name="referee"></a><strong>Q: What if I have an issue with a referee?<br /></strong>
<strong>A:</strong>Please try to keep in mind that players get the chance to practice during the week, but the referees only have game days to perfect their craft. Be mindful of mistakes, as each game is an opportunity for everyone to learn. Remind parents that they should not communicate directly with the referee, either during OR after the game. Refrain from any inappropriate comments concerning the players, the coaches, the refs, or parents. Verbal or physical violence will not be tolerated. Please report any Referee issues to the NSC Referee Director.</p>

<p><a name="parent"></a><strong>Q: What if I have an issue with a parent?<br /></strong>
<strong>A:</strong>Please try to deal with the issue in a calm and responsible manner. If you cannot resolve the situation amongst yourselves, report it to the NSC President . They will take care of it, and/or bring it to the attention of the board if necessary. Refrain from any inappropriate comments concerning the players, the coaches, the refs, or parents. Verbal or physical violence will not be tolerated.</p>

<p><a name="licenses"></a><strong>Q: How do I acquire the various coaching licenses?<br /></strong>
<strong>A:</strong>You can visit the MYSA Coaching website to see the list of current coaching courses. &nbsp;All North Soccer Club coaches are required to obtain their G license from Mass Youth Soccer. These classes are scheduled right in town and/or around the state. &nbsp;Once you have completed an approved SRI course, send a copy of your certificate to the NSC Treasurer to receive your tuition reimbursement.</p>

<p><a name="jewelery"></a><strong>Q: Are my players allowed to wear jewelery during practices or games?<br /></strong>
<strong>A:</strong>NO jewelry of any kind (earrings, necklaces, bracelets, etc.) may be worn to play or practice soccer. Tape or band-aids over earrings is not acceptable. Serious injury has occurred when a player wearing earrings has been struck in the earlobe, so this is not optional - please, have the players take them out before the game!</p>
<p>Medical bracelets must be covered with a wristband, or taped accordingly.</p>
<p>This rule is a mandate handed down to all soccer organizations and is enforced by the referees. &nbsp;It is clearly stated in the handbooks the referees refer to and posted on the <a title="USSoccer" target="_blank" href="http://www.ussoccer.com/Referees/Resource-Center-Deactivated.aspx">USSoccer website</a>.</p>
