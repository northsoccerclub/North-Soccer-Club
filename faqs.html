<p><strong><a name="tryouts"></a>Q: What is the purpose of tryouts?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> The purpose of tryouts is to be able to group players of equal ability together in order to place them in a facility where they will be most competitive. It is extremely important for all kids to attend the tryouts. If there are extenuating circumstances forcing your child to miss tryouts you must notify the club prior to the tryout date of their absence. Also note that if you child misses tryouts they will be placed on a team, if room, per North Soccer Club's board discretion.</p>
<p><strong><a name="age"></a>Q: What is the established age cutoff?</strong><br /><strong>A:</strong> North Soccer Club abides by the age cutoff guidelines established by Mass Youth Soccer Association (MYSA). The age deadlines can be viewed at: <a title="MYSA Age Deadlines" target="_blank" href="http://www.mayouthsoccer.org/pages/211_age_groups.cfm">http://www.mayouthsoccer.org/pages/211_age_groups.cfm</a></p>
<p><strong><a name="cut"></a>Q: Will my child be cut?</strong> <br /><strong>A:</strong> The North Soccer Club firmly believes that all children that are interested in playing the sport of soccer should be able to do so. We do our best to roster as many players as possible. Sometimes we may need to place players on a waiting list because we are limited by the various facilities as to the number of players that can be rostered on each team. It has been our experience that very few players remain on a waiting list. In the past, we have almost always been able to clear the waiting list at some point during the season. Any player that is unable to be rostered will receive a full refund.</p>
<p><strong><a name="notified"></a>Q: When will my child be notified which team he/she is on?</strong> <br /><strong>A:</strong> A tentative notification date will be communicated the day of the tryouts. Sometimes the review of tryout results may take longer, so please be patient as mentioned above we do try and roster everyone if possible. Final notification will occur only once all teams (boys &amp; girls all age groups) have been finalized.</p>
<p><strong><a name="practice"></a>Q: When will my child play and practice?</strong> <br /><strong>A:</strong> Winter Indoor - The NSC uses several indoor facilities which include Forekicks in Norfolk, The Hab in Uxbridge, The Dome in Bridgewater and The John Smith Bubble in Milford. Schedules are determined by each facility independently of the NSC and do not become available until one week prior to the first game. NSC does its best to secure practice time during the indoor season, however space is tight and is not guaranteed on a weekly basis. Practices are held at a local school gym (Amvet, Community, High School, Plainville) when time is available. Spring/Fall - The NSC participates in the BAYS (Boston Area Youth Soccer) league. Each team/player will have 2 practices, usually 1.5hr per, and one game per week. Practices and home games are held at a local town field (Amvet, Rose, Petti, Ruth Rhind and/or Kelly Blvd). The schedules are determined by BAYS and will consist of 5 home games and 5 away. Travel up to 45 minutes for away games may be required.</p>
<p><strong><a name="schedule"></a>Q: What happens if the schedule I receive conflicts with another activity in which my child is involved and I have to drop out of soccer?</strong> <br /><strong>A:</strong> It is the policy of NSC to extend a full refund to anyone that is unable to play due to a scheduling conflict as long as the Club is notified prior to the first game. Notification after the first game will result in a prorated refund which may also include a deduction for additional fees incurred by the club.</p>
<p><strong><a name="season"></a>Q: When does the season begin and end?</strong> <br /><strong>A:</strong> Winter Indoor -Begins in early November and runs through early April. Although various facilities break it down into two or three sessions, the NSC considers the indoor season to be one season and we ask players to commit to the entire season. Spring Season - Begins in Early April and runs through early June (10 weeks) Fall Season - Begins in early September and runs through early to mid November (10 weeks)</p>
<p><strong><a name="practice"></a>involvedQ: Are there ways I can get involved with the club or my child's team?</strong> <br /><strong>A:</strong> Yes. There may be coaching, team administrator possibilities. You an also sign up to assist in the lining of fields, fund raising events and etc&hellip; Also each month (2nd Thursday) there is an open club meeting where club operations are discussed. All are welcome to participate in these meeting and the board encourages all to come and share their ideas, concerns, question and etc...</p>
<p><strong><a name="zero"></a>Q: What does zero tolerance mean?</strong> <br /><strong>A:</strong> Here is the BAYS (Boston Area Youth Soccer) explanation: All individuals responsible for a team and all spectators shall support the referee. Failure to do so will undermine the referee's authority and has the potential of creating a hostile environment for the players, the referee, and all the other participants and spectators. Consequently, BAYS has adopted and modified the following rule: No one, except the players, is to speak to the referee during or after the game. Exceptions: Coaches may ask questions before the game, call for substitutions and point out emergencies during the game, or respond to the referee if addressed. Absolutely no disputing calls, during or after the game, no remarks to the referee to watch certain players or attend to rough play. NO YELLING at the referee, EVER, and no criticism, sarcasm, harassment, intimidation, or feedback of any kind during or after the game. Violators may be ejected and are subject to disciplinary action by the BAYS Sportsmanship Review Committee. If coaches or spectators have questions regarding particular calls, rules, or a referee, or wish to give feedback regarding a referee, please contact the town soccer club referee's coordinator for the game inquestion ,or contact the BAYS Referees Representative at http://www.bays.org</p>
<p><strong><a name="tournament"></a>Q: Is tournament play mandatory?</strong> <br /><strong>A:</strong> Tournament play is highly encouraged, but not required. Tournaments allow for exposure to other teams and add to the competitive experience. Only registered Club players may be members of NSC tournament teams. Fees have been established by the Club and must be collected before play. The Club will register and pay for the team. Out of state play requires written permission from MYSA and the Board of Directors. Patches will be provided by the Club for "patch tournaments."</p>
<p><strong><a name="uniform"></a>Q: What is the NSC uniform policy?</strong> <br /><strong>A:</strong> The Club uniform consists of the Red/White club jersey, black checkered shorts and solid black socks. These items are made available by the NSC, by contacting the Equipment Director, for purchase and are required by all players. Shin pads are also a required part of the uniform and must be covered by the sock. New Shirts $30 Trade allowance for a gently used shirt toward a new shirt is $10 In the case of duplicate numbers a used shirt may be traded for another used shirt with no charge (based on availability). Socks $5 Shorts (Youth sizes) $10 Shorts (Adult sizes) $10 What is the alternates policy for indoor soccer? A: In order to ensure proper insurance coverage the North Soccer Club has adopted the following policy regarding alternate players for indoor teams: For indoor each team will have alternate players assigned to their Rosters. Alternates will be added to achieve facility roster limits and will be based on tryouts. The board will notify each Coach who their alternates are. Only properly rostered alternates can be used for games and may be called upon when teams have less than 3 available subs for a game. Alternates shall be called on a rotating basis. In the event alternate players must be used the requesting Coach must notify the Director of Player Development as soon as practical following the game. This notification can be done by e-mail (<a title="Player Development Email" href="mailto:playerdevelopment@northsoccer.com">playerdevelopment@northsoccer.com</a>). Failure to follow this procedure will place NSC players at risk and will be considered a violation of club policy.</p>
