<p><strong><big>Club History &amp; Tradition</big></strong></p>
<p>North Soccer Club was established in 1992 to provide a competitive soccer program for the youth of North Attleborough, Massachusetts. From the start, with eighty players and six teams playing at the John Smith #1 Sports Center, to the current twenty four teams playing in six different age groups and three hundred players. Our Spring and Fall soccer programs have gone from 3 Under 14 teams to the current 24 teams in Under 10, 12, 14, 16 and 19 age groups. North Soccer Club teams have won the Mansfield and Foxboro Cup tournaments along the way, including several undefeated girls' and boys' teams in top BAYS divisions. As much as we enjoy success on the field the purpose of North Soccer Club is not just to win, but to learn and enjoy the game. Once that happens, winning the game is a bonus!</p>

<p>The Club is operated by a <a href="/board" target="_top">Board of Directors</a> elected annually during the Summer.</p>
<p>The NORTH SOCCER CLUB, LTD. is recognized by the state of Massachusetts as a&nbsp;Section 501(c)(3)&nbsp;nonprofit organization.</p>

<p><strong><big>Mission Statement</big></strong></p>
<p>The Club was formed in order to provide a highly competitive alternative to the recreation program.&nbsp;Our goals were to increase interest in soccer; improve the players' soccer skills; and to develop players for the high school program. &nbsp;The 2007 North Attleborough High Boys Soccer Team proved that by winning the Hockomock title for the first time in NAHS history and finishing 3rd in the state, with 12 players on the team having played together in North Soccer Club for a number of years!</p>

<p>Our goals are to increase interest in soccer; to improve the players soccer skills; and to develop players for the high school program.</p>
